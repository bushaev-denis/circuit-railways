Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2024-03-28
  Changes:
    - Mod was full rewrited.
    - Replaced old station finding algorithm to find all station clockwise with new which find stations by distance from current train position, it should be way better.
    - Added caching, now mod calculates all stations only first time and then will be use from cache (deleting, resorting, changing wait condition for station will be reset cache)
    - Minor improvements in code, mod should use less time for calculates things.

  Changes:

    - Improved algorithm - now the center is taken relative to all stations, and not relative to the current position of the train.
    - Removed cache due to completely broken, I'll implement it on next release (maybe)
